The Java powered Carputer project.

This is the code for the Raspberry Pi powered Carputer project I developed for JavaOne 2013.  It also contains the updates for the new session at JavaOne 2014.

Essentially this provides the code to connect to an ELM327 WiFi dongle plugged into the service port on my Audi S3 (although this will work with pretty much any European car) and an accelerometer (I used the MPU9150 from Sparkfun).

There will be lots more stuff here as I continue development.
